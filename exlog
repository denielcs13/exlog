# 5 singles across. When you feel close to a stall, switch back to 445
# and try a 5RM. You'll get it. Also, gain about 25 lbs for fuck's sake."

# Thanks to Blice, we looked at Practical Programming again for advice on
# TM stalls -- the Monday-Monday, Friday-Friday progress lines are only
# for starting TM. Stalling likely indicates too much of a Monday stressor,
# providing insufficient recovery for Friday. Dropping back on Monday
# squats and having them increase at a slower rate might solve it. Taking data.
